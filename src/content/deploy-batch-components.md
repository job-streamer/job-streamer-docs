# Deploy batch components

## How to deploy
You can deploy batch components on Control-bus using [maven plugin](https://github.com/job-streamer/job-streamer-maven-plugin) or by upload a jar file that has all dependencies of components in it to Console.
Anyway, we recommend that you make a batch components project as a "maven project".
